# Building

Requires Qt5 (with MQTT module) development libraries. [homed-service-common](https://github.com/u236/homed-service-common) is cloned automatically if not present.

```sh
./build.sh
```

This clones `homed-service-common` into `../homed-common` (sibling of the repo directory) if the directory does not exist, then runs `qmake` and `make`. The resulting binary is `homed-esphome`.

## Debian package

```sh
./build-deb.sh
```

Produces `homed-esphome_<version>_<arch>.deb` in the current directory. The package installs:

| Path | Content |
|------|---------|
| `/usr/bin/homed-esphome` | Service binary |
| `/lib/systemd/system/homed-esphome.service` | systemd unit (enabled and started on install) |
| `/etc/homed/homed-esphome.conf` | Default configuration (marked as conffile) |
| `/opt/homed-esphome/` | Runtime data directory |
